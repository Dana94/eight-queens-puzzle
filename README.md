# Eight Queens Puzzle
From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle):
    <blockquote> The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other;
    thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. </blockquote>

The game can be solely accessed through the keyboard alone.
